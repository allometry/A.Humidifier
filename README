A. Humidifier (Allometry Humidifier)

This script is designed for RuneDev and is intended for filling vials with
the lunar humidify spell at any bank, including the grand exchange.

Before starting this script, ensure that your bank is currently showing both
empty and filled vials on the same tab. This script will not look for your
bank items!

In addition, it is recommended that you sell your vials at or above market
price. This script is capable of fluctuating market prices and a steep
decrease in filled vial price would make this script non-profitable.
